# phpldapadmin

This is just the phpladpadmin config + web pages. Apt-getting this pulls down apache2 and php-fpm as dependencies. Which is a problem if you already have nginx set up as your web server.

Just the needed parts are located in /usr/share/phpldapadmin and /etc/phpldapadmin.

The git has just those parts and an install script to place them in the correct directories and make the appropriate symlinks.
